##Droping Missind Data
#Now that you've explored the volunteer dataset and understand its structure and contents, it's time to begin dropping missing values.
#In this exercise, you'll drop both columns and rows to create a subset of the volunteer dataset.
#Instructions
#Drop the Latitude and Longitude columns from volunteer, storing as volunteer_cols.
Subset volunteer_cols by dropping rows containing missing values in the category_desc, and store in a new variable called volunteer_subset.
Take a look at the .shape attribute of volunteer_subset, to verify it worked correctly.

## Drop the Latitude and Longitude columns from volunteer
volunteer_cols = volunteer.drop(["Latitude", "Longitude"], axis=1)

# Drop rows with missing category_desc values from volunteer_cols
volunteer_subset = volunteer_cols.dropna(subset=["category_desc"])

# Print out the shape of the subset
print(volunteer_subset.shape)
